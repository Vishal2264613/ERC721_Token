## Introduction

MyERC721Token is a smart contract that implements the ERC721 standard, enabling the creation and management of non-fungible tokens. Each token in this contract is unique and can represent ownership of a distinct asset, such as digital art, collectibles, or virtual items.

## Features

- **ERC721 Compliance**: Implements the full ERC721 interface, ensuring compatibility with various marketplaces and wallets.
- **Minting**: Ability to mint new unique tokens with associated metadata.
- **Transfer**: Transfer tokens between addresses.
- **Ownership Tracking**: Keep track of token ownership and manage approvals for transfers.
- **Metadata**: Support for token metadata through URI functions.
- **Events**: Emits relevant events for minting, transfers, and approvals.

## Requirements

- **Solidity Version**: Compatible with Solidity version ^0.8.0.
- **Ethereum Network**: Ethereum mainnet, testnets (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby), or local Ethereum networks (e.g., Ganache).

## Deployment

1. Copy & paste the code in Remix IDE.
2. Then compile it and deploy it.
3. Start using the functions it contains.
